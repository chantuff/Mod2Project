endpoint = /top-headlines/sources

This endpoint gives live top and breaking headlines for a country, single source, or multiple sources. You can also search with keywords. Articles are sorted by the earliest date published first. This endpoint is great for retrieving headlines for use with news tickers or similar.
Example endpoint: https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=API_KEY
