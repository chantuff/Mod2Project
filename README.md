# Mod 2 Project 
I will be using HTML, Javascript, CSS and React for my project.
I will be retreiving information from https://newsapi.org
Using this api, you can locate articles and breaking news headlines from news sources and blogs across the web.
I will be using the endpoint https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines
This endpoint gives live top and breaking headlines for a country, single source, or multiple sources. You can also search with keywords. Articles are sorted by the earliest date published first. This endpoint is great for retrieving headlines for use with news tickers or similar.
Example endpoint to get country specific headlines using parameters: https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=API_KEY

I will be using the newsapi.org api for this app. It will pull top headlines from TechCrunch in real time
